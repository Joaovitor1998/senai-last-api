## About
This is part of the last challenge for SENAI CIMATEC Extension Course. It is an API to be consumed by the Front End counterpart and it can be found [here](https://github.com/Joaovitor1998/senai-last-front).

## Info
I had to build an API with all the knowledge acquired during the course using NodeJS. I also used Bcrypt and Sequelize by my own, which weren't taught during the course.

## Running
Firstly, clone this repo and then:
```bash
npm install #Install all the dependecies

ng serve #Run the serve
```

## Technologies
- NodeJS 
- Express
- Mysql2
- Sequelize
- Bcrypt
- Jsonwebtoken
- Dotenv
